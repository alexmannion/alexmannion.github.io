I only update my Artstation with my favorite 3D work that I've done,
if you're looking for more stuff that I've done, check out my [portfolio page](https://alexmannion.github.io/portfolio/).

Keep an eye on this blog as I'll be updating it with works in progress, thoughts on the industry, and various other topics related to art or the games industry.
