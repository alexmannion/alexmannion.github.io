			<h1>Alex Mannion</h1>
			<p>I'm a sophomore Game Artist at Champlain College. Check out my portfolio <a href="/about">here.</a></p>
			
			<p>
			My current plan is to specialize in 3D Environment Art and Technical Art, but I doubt that will change any time soon.<br/>
			I'm currently taking Technical Art <b>(GAA365)</b> a year ahead of schedule in attempt to jumpstart this specialization. <br/>
			I'm looking forward to my years to come as a Game Art & Animation Major, and as a 3D Artist in the industry. <br/>
