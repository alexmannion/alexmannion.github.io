						<b>Forkdrift</b>, Spring-Summer, 2020 <br/>
						Lead Artist/Level Designer, Team Size: 12 <br/>
						Created for Game Production 2, a class about collaborating with other majors under the Game Studio umbrella 
						to give us industry experience before we enter it. <i>Forkdrift</i> is an online PvP game where everyone controls a forklift,
						and is tasked with flipping others over. We created 2 game-modes and a map to go along with each mode. For Fork Frenzy,
						I took on the role of level designer, while also being the only other 3D artist on the team (at that point).
						We started as a team of 6, and then 3 weeks into the semester, we acquired 6 more teammates, and among them were 2 more artists.
						This was my first time having to onboard other artists, and create essential art-style and pipeline documentation.
						This was also the first project I worked on that released on Steam, and it recieved financial backing from Champlain College to do so.<br/>
							• Created dozens of 3D environment assets, 5 forklift models which were separated to allow for customization <br/>
							• Implemented all of my own assets within Unity <br/>
							• Programmed crane movement, part of our forklift customization, and made some pipeline enhancing tools in MAYA<br/>
							• Served as the lead artist, and the level designer for our 'Fork Frenzy' map <br/>
							• Created a modular asset kit for assembling multiple large-scale buildings <br/>
							• Created all materials and textures using Substance Designer and Photoshop <br/>
							• Had daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress with my teammates <br/>
							• Logged time spent, and managed an asset request list for our designers

						Lead Artist, Team Size: 5 <br/>
						Created for Game Production 1, a class about collaborating with other majors under the Game Studio umbrella <br/>
						to give us industry experience before we enter it. With a team of 4 others and in 3 and 1/2 weeks we created <i>Birds Can't Fly</i>,<br/>
						a childrens game using penguins fleeing a metling arctic, being bothered by walruses and whales which are a metaphor for the struggles refugees <br/>
						face trying to find a new home, and being forced out of theirs by uncontrollable causes. <br/>
							• Created 3 unique characters, 11 animations, 2 iterations of environment assets, user interface and a cutscene <br/>
							• Logged over 45 hours on this project alone while completing 3 other Game Art & Animation major-specific classes <br/>
