Dark Ages, concept by [Vladimir Manyukhin](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/5yKeO)
===============

This environment is being developed for Vince Joyal's Advanced Seminar in Game Environments class.<br/>
My goal is to work off of concept art, and maintain an enthesis on modularity and tiling textures.<br/>
### The concept

## Modeling
These past 2 weeks were spent finishing up the modeling process, and differentiating my work from the concept. 
Before I deviated too heavily however, I made some key realizations that helped me find my direction. 

### Exaggerate shapes
The first of which, is that indentations need to be exaggerated in order to appear normal. 
So for example, when I was modeling wooden paneling, I put the noticeability of the crevices from the point of view of the camera, 
above what I thought they'd look like if you were standing right next to them.
<br/>

### Cut out the sky
The second, is that geometric silhouettes are boring, and need to be broken up.<br/>
This is advice passed down by Vince Joyal that had a really strong impact on me. 
From early on I was planning out how I'd "cut out the sky", but as I broke free of the concept, I had some new plans. 
The idea to add another building in the mid-background and a well, came spontaneously a day before my most recent milestone. 
I quickly blocked out the well, and copied one of my other buildings, replaced modules, and realized they were there to stay. 
The only real detail I'd planned to add before messing around were the ropes on the houses in the front. 
**The bottom-line is,** don't be afraid of experimentation, especially when you already have modules.
Modeling in too much detail has yet to be a problem in my experience as well, so modeling in cuts and warps will go a long ways.

### Ask for feedback
The third, is that getting feedback is essential.<br/>
I've seen many people steamroll advice with excuses and hesitation, but even non-artists carry with them fresh perspective. 
In my case however, I'm lucky enough to attend a college with alumni, professors and students alike, willing to give feedback and help online. 
I'd like to thank alumni [Matthew Dismuke](https://www.artstation.com/mattd) and [Sean Napolitano](https://www.artstation.com/sean_napolitano) for their insightful feeback, 
and 4th year student [Max Laudenslager](https://www.artstation.com/maxlaudenslager) for creating and maintaining the Champlain Game Art discord server in the first place. 
Before this year I mostly waited until last minute for critique, rendering it basically useless given how limited my time remaining was. 
**So basically** when you have people willing to give you feedback, 
always accept it and consider it.<br/>
That being said, paying it forward is a good thing to do as well. 
<br/>

### Organic modeling
While using height maps as displacement maps in zBrush to create piles of rocks is one way to do it, for my scene, I decided to make my rocks/stones individually, and in 3DSMax. 
My process was very similar for sticks as well. I imagine most Max users find this common knowledge so I'll be brief. 
I created 6 different rocks basically the same way, and reused them all over my scene. This process begins with creating a simple rectangle. 
When I did this, I made sure generate mapping coords was turned on. I then applied a turbo smooth modifier and set it to smooth between levels 2 and 4. 
Then I added a noise modifier, turned fractal on, and played with values until I got something good looking. 
*Small side-note:* While the rocks were UVd properly, it's important to know that I will have to adjust the texel density for the texture to look correct. 
Finding this method saved me a ton of time, which I was soon able to use elsewhere, and really justified having these small props in such a large scene. 
<br/>

## Post-Processing & Fog
At the top of this post, I'm sure you immediately noticed my useage of fog and post-processing. 
While it seems to be a debated topic, I find adding post-processing earlyish on in the modeling process is a help. 
It's similar to how adding lighting early on helps you think about cast shadows and light intensity, 
but instead of that, you get to see how changing ambient occlusion levels, white balance, exposure, etc. will change your environment. 
These things go hand in hand in adding depth to your scene. 
To clarify, these things don't supersede the importance of good modeling, but for me it has really helped with visualizing my end result. 
<br/>

## I used my caravan generator!
I've done many things in my life that people question heavily, but making a procedural caravan generator for my Technical Art final was likely the most heavily questioned. 
I myself never fully understood the practical uses for it really, I just thought it sounded fun to make. However, I can now say I used it in a way that saved me some time. 
In the most recent screenshot, the lighting is hiding a lot of the foreground (I've already fixed this, but that'll be for next week's post), 
but there's a cart that actually has wheels that were made, UVd and scaled by my caravn generator. 
I'd like to thank past Alex for putting in months of work to save future Alex 10 minutes.

## Reflection on Week 2
Week 2 was definitely not as productive as it could have been. I ended up having to go back to fix some modularity issues, and fix that naming convention I mentioned in my last post. 
However, going back to fix these things was a really good decision, and helped me develop a better practice going forwards. My large props folder now has separate folders, 
my Foreground/Midground/Background categorization was restructured so that things are now organized by their width. This is so that switching out different modules 
with ones of the same size can be done super quickly. All in all I'm satisfied with my progress so far and will be moving on to texturing in the coming weeks.

<br/>
I'll be posting an update next week, make sure to check back in this coming Tuesday if you're interested in seeing my progress!
