Forkdrift & Production 2
===============
<br/>

## What is Production 2?
The way the class Production 2 works basically goes as follows;<br/>
Step 1 - Form a team. I was the only artist on a 6 person team. We also had 1 producer, 2 designers and 2 programmers. We are known as **Endless Suffering**.<br/>
Step 2 - Spend 3 weeks coming up with game prototypes. Each week is a different prototype. Week 1 we worked on Curb Appeal, Week 2 was Forkdrift, Week 3 was Fish'n.<br/>
Step 3 - As a team, select your favorite game and work on it for another week. We selected Forkdrift.<br/>
Step 4 - Present the game in front of the entire Third-Year game studio + spectators. We did, it went well.<br/>
Step 5 - Wait to find out if your game made the cut. Half of the games will be dissolved, and the remaining developers will be dispersed across the remaining games.<br/>

## What is Forkdrift?
Forkdrift is a game that my Production 2 team came up with in our second week of prototyping. The core idea behind Forkdrift came to me in my first Game Development class I took first year. 
I pictured forklifts smashing into eachother on a great height, trying to push each other off of the edge. I pitched this idea to my team, and it was met with no excitement initially. 
I warped the idea into a team-based game, primarily drawing inspiration from Rocket League and Super Monkey Ball, and they all eventually caved. Week 4 came, and we unanimously voted to take this game forward.<br/>
<br/>
During the first week of development, we were trying to sort out the main gamemode, and though some form of capture the flag would be the way to go. 
While this was fun to us, we realized through some informal QA testing that people preferred wrecking stuff and knocking their enemies around. 
To remedy this, we brainstormed new modes, and decided that a King of the Hill approach might be better. This will work better in terms of drawing the players together, 
and forcing players to interact more, as they'll need to work together to get the opposing team away from capture points.<br/>
We also currently have 1 map for this mode, entitled *Shipyard*, which was created to give players the ability to knock their enemies around a bit more.<br/>

### Why this game tho?
Well, because it was incredibly fun for all of us to work on, and as an idea, it played to all of our strengths as developers. 
Seeing as I'm primarily an environment artist, I don't have to worry about making characters or 2D art, and can focus on level assets. 
It also gives me the possibility to take on a Technical Artist role in terms of tool design, and I could take the lead on forklift customization.<br/>
My teammates are looking forwards to the ability to work on a networked game involving in-depth mechanics and hopefully tons of user-feedback.<br/>
<br/>
We don't currently know the fate of Forkdrift, however the council of *gamers* will decide before the day is out.<br/>

## Ok so.. Forklift?

***Yuh***
<br/><br/>
We had a ton of fun with every prototype we worked on, but our first week of development on Forkdrift definitely felt the best. We managed time well, shared our progress, and all understood the game idea very well. 
As a result of our consistent interpretation of the concept, we had no miscommunications, and were able to work efficiently on a game that played to all of our strengths. 
I modeled the forklift and environment assets, and completed necessary documentation. My teammates on the other hand completely finished the gamemode, 
created a level, and made the forklift driving feel unbelievably amazing considering none of us had worked on a 3D driving game before, and considering we only had 1 week of development.
