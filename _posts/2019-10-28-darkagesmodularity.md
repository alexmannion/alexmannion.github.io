Dark Ages, concept by [Vladimir Manyukhin](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/5yKeO)
===============

This environment is being developed for Vince Joyal's Advanced Seminar in Game Environments class.<br/>
My goal is to work off of concept art, and maintain an enthesis on modularity and tiling textures.<br/>
### The concept

## Making cutouts

This past week was spent working on different tracings of the concept. They focused on modularity, props and materials.<br/>
Pictured above is my modularity "cut-out" (tracing) where I highlighted different modules and where they'll be reused.<br/>
I also went back into UE4 and replaced cubes with planes that were 1mx1m, 2x2m, 4xm, etc.. <br/>
This gave me a better idea of my module scale, so I could start modeling in more detail.<br/>
<br/>

## Establishing pipeline
Environment art normally involves a wide variety of software, and switching back and forth between them frequently. <br/>
Seeing as this is my first deep-dive into UE4, it took a bit to get used to the constant exporting and importing of assets.<br/>
Though at times a hastle, I found this pretty helpful to make sure I was scaling things correctly to the concept.<br/>
I also broke off chunks of my blockout in UE4 and brought them into 3DSMax for a more direct scale comparison.<br/>
After the plane for the module was created, I deleted the UE4 reference, exported the module, and replaced it in scene.<br/>
<br/>

## Modeling
This week my goal was to model roughly 40%-50% of the modules. I primarily wanted to create some base-level detail on most modules.<br/>
I had some questions to ask Vince however, so I ended up holding off on modeling rooves and much of the front left building.<br/>
Now that we've had class, my questions have been answered, and I've recieved some direction, I'll be back to modeling ASAP.<br/>
My goal for the next week is to finish modeling all foreground and most midground assets.<br/>
Background assets and props are being put on hold as I may end up extending the scene beyond what's in the concept.<br/>
This would mean that some background assets and props could end up requiring less/more detail, or even be removed entirely.<br/>
Best to avoid time waste for an already ambitious project.<br/>

## Reflection on Week 1
I think my largest mistake in week 1 the naming convention I decided on.<br/>
This environment will include well over 10 modules, so knowing where things are structurally is important.<br/>
I ended up overcomplicated the naming of my assets and files, so at the moment, finding specific files is a chore.<br/>
It is however better than undercomplicating things, so I feel I'm getting closer to nailing down a convention that works best for me.<br/>
*For those curious*, I broke up assets by foreground, midground and background, and whether they were on the right or left of the scene.<br/>
I used FG, MG, BG as prefixes for foreground, midground and background, and L and R for left and right. Ex. file name is MGL_UpperHouse<br/>
<br/>
My most notable victory from week 1 was, without a doubt, the solidity of my blockout. This freed me up to continue onto modeling with ease.<br/>
Replacing my to-scale blockout planes was incredibly easy, and now I have a really solid foundation to build off of.<br/>
