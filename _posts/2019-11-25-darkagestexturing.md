Dark Ages, concept by [Vladimir Manyukhin](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/5yKeO)
===============

This environment is being developed for Vince Joyal's Advanced Seminar in Game Environments class.<br/>
My goal is to work off of concept art, but maintain an enthesis on modularity and tiling textures.<br/>
Reusability is key.<br/>
### The concept

### Substance Designer
For the past 3 weeks I've been working on materials for this project.
This was the first time I was creating materials with exposable parameters in mind. 
With certain randomization and control parameters, I was able to texture basically all of my scene 
using only 4 matrials. I have graphs for stone, ground, stucco and roofing. 
This will likely change as I make more props, but so far this has worked wonders. 
By adjusting sliders and toggles I've been able to make tons of material varients. 
Coupled with my master materials, this has been a really efficient addition to my workflow.
<br/>

### Vertex Painting
After I created my material varients, I used a method of masking called vertex painting, 
which assigns data to vertices, allowing for different material varients to be used on the same mesh. 
This was done all over my scene, and will be done more in the future.  <br/>
Here are examples of basecolors generated by my stone material graph. <br/>

<br/>

The place in my scene where you may think vertex painting is most recognizablely happening is on the ground, 
but that's actually landscape blending layers. These function similarly to Multi/Sub Materials in 3DSMax, 
only you're able to paint material IDs on the mesh in real-time. You simply select the material, 
and draw on the mesh. 
<br/>
*To clarify*, this is technically a form of vertex painting. There's information stored 
within the vertices, but it's handled in a different way by game engines, so I like to differentiate.
<br/>

### Multi/Sub Materials
Multi-subs are materials that can contain other materials. This is how I'm able to put multiple materials on one object. 
You basically just assign material IDs to the faces that are going to draw from a certain material, and orient the UVs according to the material.
