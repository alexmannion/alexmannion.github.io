Dark Ages, concept by [Vladimir Manyukhin](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/5yKeO)
===============

This environment is being developed for Vince Joyal's Advanced Seminar in Game Environments class.<br/>
My goal is to work off of concept art, but maintain an enthesis on modularity and tiling textures.<br/>
Reusability is key.<br/>
### The concept

### Substance Designer
For the past 3 weeks I've been working on materials for this project.
This was the first time I was creating materials with exposable parameters in mind. 
With certain randomization and control parameters, I was able to texture basically all of my scene 
using only 6 matrials. I have graphs for stone, ground, wood, stucco, metal and roofing.  
By adjusting sliders and toggles I've been able to make tons of material varients. 
Coupled with my master materials, this has been a really efficient addition to my workflow.
<br/>

### Vertex Painting
After I created my material varients, I used a method of masking called vertex painting, 
which assigns data to vertices, allowing for different material varients to be used on the same mesh. 
This was done all over my scene, and will be done more in the future.
Here are examples of basecolors generated by my stone material graph. <br/>

<br/>

The place in my scene where you may think vertex painting is most recognizablely happening is on the ground, 
but that's actually landscape blending layers. These function similarly to Multi/Sub Materials in 3DSMax, 
only you're able to paint material IDs on the mesh in real-time. You simply select the material, 
and draw on the mesh. 
<br/>
*To clarify*, this is technically a form of vertex painting. There's information stored 
within the vertices, but it's handled in a different way by game engines, so I decided to differentiate. 
<br/>

### Multi/Sub Materials
Multi-subs are materials that can contain other materials. This is how I'm able to put multiple materials on one object. 
You basically just assign material IDs to the faces that are going to draw from a certain material, and orient the UVs according to the material. 
I used this for every single object in my scene. I had a single multi/sub material with basecolor bitmaps of all of the materials I created, and used 
material IDs and UV orientation to map my materials. This is my second environment ever, and my first one where I made 100% of the materials and decals myself. 
The mutli/sub material process was truly the biggest helper when it came to accelerating my workflow this semester. 
<br/>

## Hay Roofing
This was my biggest cause for confusion and disorientation during these past 2 weeks. 
While there was a brief class demo on creating foliage, it left some gaps that I had to sort out. 
The most major of which was very broad; *How do I apply this knowledge to thatched roofing?* 
I knew I'd likely have to find out the hard way, and spend some quality time experimenting. 
I found the most efficient way for me was to make 2 varients of hay, put them in a multi/sub material, and assign them to differnet planes, which had their UVs overlaid on the hay texture. 
<br/>

<br/>
After some rounds of reimport and export I finally got the hay looking decent. 
Above is the image I used as a base for the hay.

## Reflection on Weeks 4 & 5
During week 4, I made some really great strides in differentiating my image from the concept. I added the well in the front, and some ropes to better lead the eye, as well as some rocks and sticks. 
A big problem I had throughout a lot of this project was finding a good source light direction and intensity, I think this could not come across clearer than in my week 4 screenshot. 
Eventually this was resolved through relying more heavily on post-processing and spotlights to convey the scene's ambience. 
This dawned on me after posting my week 4 screenshot for critique, and since then I've been experimenting and making strides. 

<br/>
I decided to only post updates when substantial progress has been made. My next update will likely be after the project is done, and it will be in the form of a reflection. <br/>
Since it took so long for me to update this blog post, I'll share my current progress below. Make sure to check in for my reflection and final images next week!<br/>
