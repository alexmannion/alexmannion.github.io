Forkdrift & Production 2
===============
<br/>

## What's new?

We've remade our gamemode, added a HUD, refined the forklift controller and the art style, updated the render pipeline to URP, and got hit with a routine-shattering global pandemic! 
Given the issue of relocation, some of us were without computers for a considerable amount of time and had to get creative. Here's some Animal Crossing / Forkdrift fan-art made by Tessa!<br/>

Given the current situation we all find ourselves in, some people have had priority and accessibility shifts, so Forkdrift development has taken a hit. 
I was originally set up to take on the role of a technical artist, which I still do to an extent, but given changes in people's availability and prioritization, I'm going back to environments. 
It has been a nice change of pace from working on my current adv. seminar piece, although it has been a struggle switching back and forth between realism and stylized so regularly. 
And like I said, I still have some technical responsibilities such as dealing with the transition to URP, all lighting-related setup, and creating new gradient materials which will expedite our texturing process.

### How COV-19 has impacted development
First off, being forced out of our dorms, which we're still paying for, was pretty jarring for myself, the team, and the people we ended up living with. 
The entire situation has impacted everyone differently, but for the most part we're all still really excited and inspired to keep working on Forkdrift. 
While the extended spring break and the half-sprint following it really challenged us as a team, we've persevered and made a great deal of progress since. 
Hopefully going into finals week we're able to maintain this momentum and keep up the good work.
