			<hr width=30%, align=center> <br/>
			<p>I'm an aspiring 3D artist with a background in videography and computer aided design.</p>
			<p>
			Before attending Champlain College, I had little to no artistic experience, and didn't even consider 3D modeling art. My view has certainly changed since then. 
			I have become intimately familiar with how much passion, creativity and drive is required to become a good 3D artist, especially within 4 years. 
			In my first year at this college I realized I had a lot of catching up to do, and made sure to stay practiced and make use of that few advantages I had. 
			The main one being, my love for programming and understanding the technical side of game development. I'd originally applied to Champlain as a Game Designer, 
			but my girlfriend at the time made me realize that what I really wanted to be was a 3D artist.<br/><br/>
			
			Since then I've been keeping in touch with my roots as a programmer, while mostly focusing on advancing my artistic ability, and pushing myself wherever possible. 
			Unfortunately I'm not a machine, and I need to take breaks from 3D modeling sometimes. In my free time recently, I've been learning French and playing a lot of tennis. 
			I also have been playing guitar and drums for a couple years, and love movies and television as well.<br/>
			Some of my favorite shows and movies are Malcolm in The Middle, Lost, Twin Peaks, Merlin, everything Monty Python, and the Lord of The Rings movies (Extended Editions). <br/><br/>
			
			Here's a list of some all-time favorite video-games! - <br/>
