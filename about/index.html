			<hr width=30%, align=center> <br/>
			<p>I'm an aspiring 3D artist with a background in videography and computer aided design.</p>
		
			<p>I love learning about and engaging with all types of creative, innovative, and emerging media. 
			Back when the original Oculus Rift developer kit came out, I spent all my money on one and fell in love. 
			Since then I've expanded into other areas of emerging media, such as 3D printing, laser cutting, and of course, game development. 
			Last school year I worked at Champlain College's Emerging Media Center as a lab technician. Over the summer I moved onto one of their project teams. 
			My role on the project was assisting with UI/UX design and flow of an electrophysiology visualization program, and assisting the graphic designer in implementing her assets into the engine. <br/>
			
			Before attending Champlain College, I had little to no artistic experience, and didn't even consider 3D modeling art. My view has certainly changed since then. 
			I have become intimately familiar with how much passion, creativity and drive is required to become a good 3D artist, especially within 4 years. <br/>
			My dream is to work on a team that's at least as driven and intrinsically motivated to hone their craft as me. 
			Judging by the people I've met who were either in the game industry or ended up in it shortly after, it doesn't sound like that will be too difficult.
			
			<p>Check out my portfolio, read my blog entires and don't hesitate to reach out to me on social media, my active ones are linked below.<br/>
			I'm currently looking into environment and technical art internship opportunities for Summer, 2020.<br/>
