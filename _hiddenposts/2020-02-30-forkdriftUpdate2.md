Forkdrift & Production 2
===============
<br/>

## What's new?

Our systems designer is working on gameplay research, trying to help solidify our gamemode. 
Our level designer is working on an entirely new shipyard map, and programmers are focused on fine-tuning the forklift controller. 
The UI team is hard at work on a new menu, and Rachel, our new 2D artist, recently finished our new logo!<br/><br/>

My current role is to oversee the art pipeline and make sure things are being done efficiently, and with cohesion. 
Seeing as we have an awesome team, that work doesn't require much time. So, Tessa and me are currently working on finalizing an art style. 
In the meantime, I've started on forklift customization. I made another forklift, and updated the old one.<br/><br/>

It has been a lot of fun working with other artists, and having a designated 2D artist really helps my mental state. 
While I didn't do any 2D art for Forkdrift prior to Greenlight, it was still a big pile of stress looming over me, 
so now having someone to do that stuff for me (and better than me) is a big help.<br/><br/>

Prior to this week, my main focus was on making a tool that aids with asset creation. I wrote a script in Python for MAYA that focuses on 
maintaining propper Forklift scale and consistent/accurate pivots. This was meant to keep things consistent between Tessa and me, 
and prevent the level designer and programmers from hating our guts. I used this tool when I made the latest forklift and it helped tremendously.<br/>

## Reflection on Greenlight

Up until Greenlight actually happened I was convinced that it was some form of torture. Everyone fighting about which game will go forwards, 
confusion over games not showing gameplay in their trailers, having to embrace working under someone else, and worst of all, having your project cut.
<br/><br/>
Now that some time has passed, my views have changed, and I entirely understand why we underwent that process, and I can definitely appreciate it. 
It wasn't as though 2 games were plucked at random, they were chosen carefully by a jury of classmates, who were instructed to only think about which games were best fit to continue. 
I know it's easy for me to say because the game I worked on went through, but it seemed to me that the deliberation was thorough, and everyone was satisfied in the end. 
The presentation infront of the entire game studio was a really solid way of practicing our presentation skills, and selling our game to potential future teammates. 
In addition, it was also good practice for when we do the same thing again, but with more pressure, for Capstone, next semester.
<br/><br/>
After the approved games were decided, it was up to the members of the class to decide which game they wanted to work on. 
So long as both teams in the class felt it fair, whatever people wanted to work on, they were allowed to work on. 
This was a really nice start to our new team because we knew our new memebers wanted to be there.
<br/><br/>
I think so far, we're all happy with the transition, and are somehow communicating even better. 
All of us, both the original memebers of Endless Suffering and the new ones, were concerned about the transition. 
After 2 weeks with our new team, it seems as though everyone has fallen into place, the gears are turning, and I'm very much looking forwards to the future of Forkdrift.
